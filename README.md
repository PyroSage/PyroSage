Hi, I am PyroSage(Bhaskar Biswas)
Welcome to my Github profile! I am an undergraduate pursuing engineering physics at IIT Bombay and an intermediate programmer in Python, Java, C and C++. I also have knowledge of Linux and GitHub.

Currently, I am a Driverless Trainee in IIT Bombay Racing Team, where I am working on autonomous vehicle technology. In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal programming projects, such as making a flappy bird game in Unreal and a line-follower bot in Arduino.

I am always seeking to expand my skills and knowledge, and I am open to collaboration and learning opportunities. Please feel free to reach out to me with any ideas or opportunities that you think might interest me.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I hope you find my work here interesting and useful.
